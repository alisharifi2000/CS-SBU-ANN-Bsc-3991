<h1> Course Description </h1>

The goal of “Neural Networks” is to realize artificial intelligent systems using the human brain as the model. In this course, we will introduce the basics of neurons and network models, learning algorithms, architectures, and some applications of neural networks. At the end of this course, students will be able to use neural networks for solving different problems related to pattern recognition, function approximation, data visualization, and so on. Basically, students will learn how to answer the following questions for a given problem:

* What kind of structure or model should they use? 
* How to train or design the neural network? 
* How to use neural networks for knowledge acquisition?
